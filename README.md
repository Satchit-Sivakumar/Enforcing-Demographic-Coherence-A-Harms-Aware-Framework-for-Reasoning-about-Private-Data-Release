# Enforcing-Demographic-Coherence-A-Harms-Aware-Framework-for-Reasoning-about-Private-Data-Release
This repository contains artifacts accompanying paper submission to IEEE S&amp;P 2026. There are two main things in this repository:

a) SubmissionCode.py: The code used in Section 5 of the paper that uses the demographic coherence enforcement framework to expose the vulnerabilities of a hypothetical data release. The associated dataset is linked as national2019.csv, and as described in the paper comes from the NIST ACS Data Excerpts Benchmark. In order to run the code, simply download the code and dataset, replace the path address to the dataset in the code where specified. You will also need the packages used (scikit-learn, numpy, matplotlib, scipy, pandas) which are all common public packages.

b) A full version of the paper containing all the proofs of theoretical results from the paper submission.
